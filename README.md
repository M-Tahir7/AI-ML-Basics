AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a domain of computer science in which we mimic the thinking and understanding process of the human brain.
Its goal is to create a digital brain that can think like humans, make decisions, and solve problems.

📌 Example:
If you ask Siri or Google Assistant something and it responds, then it is using AI.

________________________________________

 In simple words, it tells us what is the best thing to do in any situation to get the best result.

Imagine a student is preparing for an exam. He tries different strategies:

Sometimes he studies late at night.

Sometimes he studies early in the morning.

Sometimes he uses YouTube videos.

Sometimes he reads textbooks.

Over time, he notices this:

📌 “Whenever I wake up early and revise with YouTube videos, I score higher in quizzes.”

Asking kids open-ended questions like “What’s your favorite color?” gives different answers — like normal AI, which gives varied responses.

But if you give them a math question like “(3 + 2) × 4”, they all say “20” — like Q*, which finds the single best answer in any situation.

So he learns:
✅ Best Action = Wake up early + Watch videos

________________________________________

Machine Learning (ML) says:

"Just give me inputs and outputs (past data), and I’ll learn the pattern behind them. Once I learn the pattern, I can predict answers for future inputs."

Deep Learning (DL) goes a step further:

"I’m inspired by how the human brain works. I use artificial 'neurons' (which are actually mathematical functions), and when many of them are connected together in layers, we call that a neural network."

________________________________________

Labelled data is the type of data where each input is provided along with its correct output (label).

📌 Example:
If you're shown an image of an apple and told that "this is an apple," then that is labelled data.
The machine learns from such labelled data, like:
Image → Apple
Image → Not Apple

________________________________________

Unlabelled data is the type of data where inputs are provided without any labels — meaning, we don't know the correct output for each input.

📌 Example:
Images stored in your phone gallery are unlabelled because they are not tagged with what they contain (like "apple", "car", or "person").
Most of the data in the real world is unlabelled.

________________________________________

Structured data is the type of data that is organized in rows and columns, making it easy to store and analyze — just like in an Excel spreadsheet.
📌 Example:
An Excel file where each row represents a person and each column represents features like Name, Age, and Gender.


Unstructured data is data that does not have a organized structure like rows and columns. It includes things like texts, images, videos, and speech.

Example:

Emails or written documents

Photos stored on your phone

Audio clips

Video recordings

Reinforcement Learning Explanation (Based on Example)
Scenario: Gharwale bike chalana sikhate hain. Rules batate hain. Environment define karte hain. Kab brake lagani hai, kya sahi hai kya nahi.

🧠 Mapping to RL Concepts:
Real-life Term	RL Term
Gharwale rules batate hain	Environment + Reward policy
"Ghar ke andar nahi chalani"	Environment constraint
Brake, race, kick sikhana	Action space
Aram se drive karna	Optimal policy learned
Wheeling karna	Undesirable behavior
Gharwale mana karte hain	Negative reward (punishment)
Baccha wheeling chhor deta hai	Unlearning due to penalty

________________________________________

🔁 Learning + Unlearning:
Jab baccha aram aram se chalata hai → positive reward milta hai (tareef, encouragement).

Jab wo wheeling karta hai → negative reward (daant, punishment).

Jab ye negative feedback repeat hota hai → wo unlearn karta hai wheeling ko.

Reinforcement Learning mein agent action karta hai, environment usay reward ya punishment deta hai, aur agent apna behavior update karta hai.

📌 Summary:
Learning = Bike chalana sikhna through positive reinforcement.

Unlearning = Wheeling chhodna due to repeated negative reinforcement.

RL Concept = Agent interacts with environment, learns from reward and punishment.

_______________________________________

✅ Supervised Learning
There’s a small child at my home, and I often teach him the names of different fruits:

🍎 "This is an apple"
🍌 "This is a banana"
🍊 "This is an orange"

One day, I showed him an apple and asked:
"What is this?"
He replied confidently:
"It's an apple!"

_______________________________________

Unsupervised Learning
Now imagine I send someone to the market with this instruction:
"Buy fruits or vegetables you like."

🛒 They go to the store and pick whatever seems good to them, based on their personal preferences – without being told what to buy specifically.

📌 This represents Unsupervised Learning – where the model doesn’t get labeled data but finds patterns or groups things on its own.

________________________________________

Deep Learning Overview
In deep learning, we can still apply supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning, but the difference is that the model is trained using artificial neurons.

What is a Neuron?
A neuron in deep learning is a mathematical function.
For example, one simple function is the Relu neuron (max function):
•	It takes two numbers as input.
•	It outputs the larger number.
This is similar to how biological neurons in the human brain take inputs, process them, and pass outputs to other neurons.
________________________________________
Connecting Neurons
Just like the human brain has billions of interconnected neurons that make decisions, in deep learning we connect artificial neurons to form a neural network.
This arrangement of neurons can have different architectures depending on the problem.
________________________________________
Data in ML vs. DL
•	Machine Learning (ML) works well with structured data (tables, rows, columns).
•	Deep Learning (DL) can work with both structured and unstructured data(Text , Image , Voice):
o	Text → becomes Natural Language Processing (NLP)
o	Images → becomes Computer Vision
o	Voice/Speech → becomes Speech Recognition

________________________________________

Discriminative AI vs Generative AI
1. Discriminative AI
•	Definition:
Focuses on distinguishing between different classes or categories.
It learns patterns in data to decide “What class does this belong to?”
•	Goal: Classification or prediction.
•	Example:
o	Email spam detection (Spam or Not Spam)
o	Image classification (Cat or Dog)
________________________________________
2. Generative AI
•	Definition:
Focuses on creating new data that resembles the original data.
It may use discriminative AI techniques internally to understand patterns, but its main goal is generation, not classification.
•	Example:
o	ChatGPT writing an essay
o	 Creating Ghibli image from text
o	AI making new music

________________________________________

In deep learning, the word deep comes from the depth of the neural network, meaning:
•	We don’t just have one or two layers of neurons (like in simple neural networks)
•	Instead, we have many hidden layers between the input and output layers.
•	More layers = more neurons = the model can learn more complex patterns.
So, “deep” is about layer depth
For example:
•	Shallow Neural Network → 1–2 hidden layers
•	Deep Neural Network → 3+ hidden layers (can go into hundreds in big architectures like ResNet, GPT, etc.)

________________________________________

Generative AI & LLMs
Generative AI uses certain aspects of Discriminative AI (pattern recognition) but goes further — it creates new information such as text, images, or audio.
For text data, two important model families are:
1.	LLMs (Large Language Models)
2.	Diffusion Models (e.g., Latent Diffusion Models for image generation)
Both can use special neural network architectures like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) — these have billions of parameters (like artificial neurons) working together.

________________________________________

Tokenization in LLMs
•	LLMs don’t directly understand raw text; they break text into tokens (small chunks like words or sub-words).
•	Example: "I’m learning AI" → [ "I", "’m", " learning", " AI" ]
•	GPT understands a fixed vocabulary (e.g., ~50,000 tokens it has learned during training).
•	If a token is out of vocabulary, the model won’t interpret it correctly.
•	Context Window = the maximum number of tokens the LLM can process at once.
o	GPT-3.5 → ~4k tokens
o	GPT-4 → 8k–32k tokens (depending on version)

________________________________________

Prompt Engineering Steps
To get the best results from an LLM, your prompt should include:
•  Simulate Persona → Define the role the model should take.
Example: “You are an expert Python developer.”
•  Task → Clearly state what you want the model to do.
Example: “Write a function to reverse a string.”
•  Steps → Explain how to approach the problem (break it into parts).
Example: “First, take input from the user, then reverse it, and finally print the result.”
•  Context / Constraints → Give boundaries or rules for the answer.
Example: “Do not use built-in reverse functions; only use loops.”
•  Goal → Describe the desired outcome.
Example: “The program should work for any string entered by the user.”
•  Output Format → Tell how you want the results presented.
Example: “Return the code inside a single Python code block.”

________________________________________

LLMs vs Diffusion Models
________________________________________

1. LLMs (Large Language Models)
LLMs are actually Transformers — a type of neural network architecture.

You get better results when you give clear, step-by-step prompts.

Adding emotional touch in prompts can improve the quality of generated content.

________________________________________

2. Diffusion Models
Diffusion models generate images based on text prompts.

Example: Stable Diffusion (comes under Computer Vision).

You can sell generated images, but success depends on good prompt writing.

Negative Prompts → Used to exclude unwanted elements from the image.

They are computationally expensive, so latent representation is used:

Instead of representing an image with millions of numbers (pixels), it’s represented with fewer (e.g., 1,000) numbers.

This makes training faster and more efficient.

________________________________________

3. Noise in Diffusion Models
   
Noise = Random variation added to the image data (like static on TV).

The model is trained to remove noise and recover the real image.

Forward process: Gradually add noise to an image over time.

Backward process: Gradually remove noise to reconstruct the image.

Example: Drawing too many lines on a picture, then removing them step-by-step until the original image appears.

________________________________________

4. Two Ways to Add/Remove Noise
  1) Equal step noise addition → Add equal noise at each step, then remove it.

  2)Cosine similarity noise → Uses a cosine schedule for adding noise.
    (Forward process and Reverse process)
    Cosine schedule → add blur slowly at first, faster in the middle, then slow down again — giving a smoother transformation.
    It uses a cosine-shaped curve for adding noise

________________________________________

5. Latent Diffusion Components
Autoencoder → Compresses image into a smaller latent space.

U-Net → Learns to remove noise.

Text Autoencoder → Encodes the prompt into embeddings.

Guided Noise Removal → The process of removing noise in a controlled sequence.

________________________________________

6. Embeddings
Embeddings = Numerical representation of text prompts (meaning is stored as numbers).

The model uses embeddings to understand what the prompt means and guide image creation.

________________________________________

1) API as a Waiter: 
•	Customer (You) → Makes a request (like ordering food).
•	Waiter (API) → Takes your request and delivers it to the Kitchen (Server).
•	Kitchen → Prepares the food (processes the data or performs the required operation).
•	Waiter (API) → Brings the food (response) back to you.
•	Key point: You don’t know (or need to know) how the kitchen works — only how to place the order correctly.

________________________________________

2️) Example with Google Search
•	When you type something into Google and hit Search, your browser is sending a request to Google’s Search API.
•	The API sends your query to Google’s servers, fetches relevant results, and sends them back.
•	You just see the results; you don’t see the inner algorithms, databases, or processing steps.

CODE OF SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

import openai

# Replace with your actual key
openai.api_key = "sk-your_real_api_key_here"




def sentiment_analysis(text):

    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a sentiment analysis assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"Analyze the sentiment of this text: {text}"}
    ]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=messages,
        max_tokens=50,
        temperature=0
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].message['content']
    result = sentiment_analysis("I hate you.")
    print("Sentiment:", result)

________________________________________

🖼 DALL·E, CLIP & Diffusion Models

DALL·E and DALL·E 3 are AI models for generating images from text prompts.

They are built on diffusion models, which create images step-by-step from random noise, refining them until the final picture appears.

DALL·E uses CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) technology.

Text Encoder → Converts the text prompt into a vector.

Image Encoder → Converts images into vectors.

These vectors are compared for similarity, ensuring the generated image matches the text.

Once the text–image relationship is established, a diffusion-based decoder generates the image.
________________________________________

📦 Pipeline: 

A pipeline is just a sequence of steps to process data.

Think of ordering a pizza:

Choose toppings

Bake the pizza

Deliver it

In AI, the pipeline processes data step-by-step, e.g., text → vector → model processing → output.

________________________________________

🔢 Tensors:

A tensor is basically a multi-dimensional matrix used to store data (numbers) in deep learning.

1D tensor = vector, 2D tensor = matrix, higher dimensions store more complex data (like images or videos).

________________________________________

🤗 Hugging Face:

Hugging Face is a platform with thousands of ready-to-use AI models.

You can find models for:

Text summarization

Translation

Sentiment analysis

Image generation

And many more

Always check the model size before loading in notebook — large models can crash your notebook if they exceed memory limits.

📊 Data Science Overview
Data Science is a multi-disciplinary field because it combines concepts from many areas like statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain knowledge.
Its main goal is to extract insights from data to make better decisions.

________________________________________

1️⃣ Step 1: Data Acquisition
In this step, data can come from various sources such as:
Databases
Data Lakes
Data Warehouses
This is the starting point of any data science project.

________________________________________

2️⃣ Step 2: Data Preparation & EDA
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is very important because we need to understand:

What type of data we have

The meaning of each attribute (column)

How values are distributed because of inconsistencies i.e age = 670 

Whether there are missing or incorrect values

________________________________________


📌 Types of Data

1. Nominal Data
Categories without order or rank.

Example: Red, Green, Blue.

2. Binary Data
Only two unique values.

Example: Yes/No, 0/1.

3. Ordinal Data
Categories with an order.

Example: A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D+, D, F.

4. Numerical Data
Numbers that represent measurable quantities.

Discrete → Only certain unique values are possible. Example: 0, 1, 2.

Continuous → Values can be measured and can take any number within a range. Example: Height, Weight, Temperature.

________________________________________

📊 Statistical Properties & Data Distribution
When analyzing data, we often look at its statistical properties and distribution.

________________________________________

1️⃣ Measures of Central Tendency
(“Central tendency” means the tendency of data to cluster around a middle value — in Urdu: “darmiyani value ki taraf jhukao”)

Mean → The average of all values.

Median → The middle value after sorting the data.

Mode → The most frequently occurring value.

________________________________________

2️⃣ Measures of Dispersion
(Shows how spread out the data is from the central value)

Standard Deviation (SD) → How much data deviates from the mean.

Variance → Square of the standard deviation.

Note: Variance & SD are meaningful only if Mean is used as the central tendency measure.

IQR (Interquartile Range) → Spread between Q3 (75th percentile) and Q1 (25th percentile).

________________________________________

3️⃣ Measures of Proximity
(Used to find similarity or closeness between two or more values/vectors)

Dot Product

Cosine Similarity

Correlation

________________________________________

4️⃣ Data Distribution
Types
Symmetric Distribution (Normal) → Mean = Median = Mode.

Asymmetric Distribution (Skewed):

Positively Skewed → Mode < Mean (tail on positive side).

Negatively Skewed → Mean < Mode (tail on negative side).

________________________________________

🔄 Step 3: Data Preprocessing
Giving the model high-quality data is crucial for better results.
Data preprocessing ensures the data is clean, consistent, and optimized for training.

1️⃣ Data Cleaning
Handle missing values (fill, remove, or impute).

Remove noise (unnecessary/random errors).

Fix inconsistencies (e.g., Age = 670).

2️⃣ Data Integration
Combine data from multiple sources into one dataset.

Example: Merging sales data from different regional databases.

3️⃣ Data Reduction
Remove less important features to make the dataset smaller and easier to process.

Also called Dimensionality Reduction.

Techniques:

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) — works using:

Eigen Decomposition

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) — useful for visualization in 2D or 3D.
________________________________________

Data Acquisition → Collecting raw data from various sources.

Preprocessing → Making data ready for modeling.

Step 1: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) → Understanding the data’s patterns, distributions, and anomalies.

Step 2: Feature Engineering → Creating and refining features for better model performance.

a) Data Cleaning → Handle missing values, remove duplicates, fix inconsistencies.

b) Data Integration → Merge multiple datasets into one coherent dataset.

c) Data Reduction → Reduce complexity by selecting important features or using dimensionality reduction.

d) Data Transformation → Change the structure or scale of data for better learning.

________________________________________

📌 Data Transformation Techniques
1. Smoothing
Purpose: Manage noisy, scattered data so the model can learn patterns effectively.

Techniques:

Regression Smoothing → Fit a regression line/curve to reduce noise.

Binning → Group nearby values into bins to reduce variability.

________________________________________

2. Discretization
Purpose: Convert numerical data into ordinal categories.

Example:

Temperature:

0–15 → Low

15–30 → High

>30 → Extreme

________________________________________

3. Normalization (Scaling)
Purpose: Bring values of different columns into a comparable scale so the model learns effectively.

Common techniques:

Z-score Standardization:

Formula: 
$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$
​
Centers data around 0 with standard deviation 1.

________________________________________

Min-Max Scaling:

$X' = \frac{X - X_{\text{min}}}{X_{\text{max}} - X_{\text{min}}}$

Transforms data into a fixed range (e.g., 0 to 1).

Works well if we know future data won’t exceed current min/max values.

________________________________________

Step 3: Analyze (After Acquire → Prepare [EDA + Feature Engineering])
In this step, we focus on finding the model that performs best on our data.

1. Choosing the Right Algorithm
If the output column contains categories → use Classification algorithms.

If the output column is continuous numeric → use Regression algorithms.

________________________________________

2. Ensemble Learning
Ensemble learning combines multiple algorithms to improve performance. There are two main types:

a) Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)

Multiple algorithms are trained in parallel.

Final decision:

Classification → Majority voting

Regression → Average prediction

Reduces variance and helps avoid overfitting.

b) Boosting

Uses weak learners (simple models) trained sequentially.

Each model focuses on fixing errors from the previous one.

Wrong predictions are given more weight in the next round.

Turns weak learners into strong learners.

________________________________________

3. Error & Performance Checking
Regression:

Check Residual error:

Positive residual → Overestimation

Negative residual → Underestimation

Classification:

Confusion Matrix

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

AUC-ROC Curve

________________________________________

4. Reporting
Present results visually for easy understanding.

Use different types of graphs, plots, and dashboards so stakeholders can quickly understand insights.

Goal → Tell a story through visualization so that even non-technical people can grasp the findings.

________________________________________

Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used when the target variable is categorical (e.g., 0 or 1).

Instead of fitting a straight line like in Linear Regression, it uses the Sigmoid (Logistic) Function to map predictions to probabilities.

Sigmoid Function
$\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$


Output is always between 0 and 1.

If probability ≥ threshold → class 1

If probability < threshold → class 0

Default threshold is 0.5, but it can be adjusted based on problem requirements.

Decision Boundary
Logistic Regression tries to find a line (in 2D) or hyperplane (in higher dimensions) that separates the classes.

Works best when the data is linearly separable — meaning a straight line can separate the categories.

Key Notes
Above 0.5 → Class 1, Below 0.5 → Class 0.

We can shift the threshold for better precision or recall, depending on the business goal.

Commonly used for:

Spam detection (Spam / Not Spam)

Medical diagnosis (Disease / No Disease)

Credit approval (Approve / Reject)

________________________________________

Decision Tree
In a decision tree, we try to find which split is pure and which is impure.

Purity is measured using Entropy or Gini Impurity.

If the value is 0, we say the split is pure (all samples belong to one class).

If the value is above 0 and closer to 1, the split is impure (mixed classes), and further splitting can be done.

Key Concepts
Entropy

Measures the randomness/impurity in a node.

Formula:

Entropy(S) = - ∑ pᵢ log₂(pᵢ)
 
Gini Impurity

Measures the probability of incorrectly classifying a randomly chosen element.

Formula:

Gini(S) = 1 - ∑ pᵢ²

 
Information Gain (IG)

Helps to decide which node should be the root node and how to split further.

Calculated at every step:

IG(S, A) = Entropy(S) − ∑ ( |Sᵥ| / |S| ) × Entropy(Sᵥ)

________________________________________

Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble machine learning technique, specifically a type of bagging method.
In Random Forest:

We use n number of Decision Trees (only Decision Trees — no other algorithms).

For each Decision Tree:

Row Sampling with Replacement (Bootstrap Sampling)

Feature Sampling with Replacement (Random Subset of Features)

Each Decision Tree is trained on its own subset of data and features.

For classification:

The final output is decided using Majority Voting Classifier.

Some data is left unused in training for each tree — called OOB (Out-of-Bag) data, approximately n/3 of the dataset.

This OOB data is used for validation, giving the OOB Score (an internal performance estimate).

________________________________________

Gradient Boosting
Gradient Boosting is an ensemble machine learning technique based on boosting.

Uses multiple Decision Trees (usually shallow trees — weak learners).

The trees are connected sequentially.

At each step, we focus on the errors (residuals) made by the previous model.

Only the data points that were predicted incorrectly (or had higher error) get more weight and influence in the next tree.

Over time, the sequence of weak learners combines to form a strong learner.

The process is guided by gradient descent, minimizing a loss function step-by-step.

Key points:

Weak Learners → small, simple Decision Trees.

Sequential Learning → each model learns from previous errors.

Loss Function Optimization → e.g., MSE for regression, Log Loss for classification.

________________________________________

Linear Data
Data is linear when the relationship between input variables (features) and the output variable can be represented by a straight line in a graph.

Data is non-linear when the relationship between features and output cannot be represented by a straight line — the pattern curves or changes direction.

________________________________________

Linear Regression
For applying linear regression, our data should be linear, and the output column must be a continuous variable.

We fit a line and try to find the one that passes closest to all the data points, so our residual error is low.

Residual Error Formula:

Residual Error
=
Actual
−
Predicted
Residual Error=Actual−Predicted
Line Equation:
y = w*x + c

c = intercept (point where line starts on Y-axis)

w = slope (how much y changes when x changes)

Cost Function:

J(w, c) = (1/n) * Σ (ŷᵢ - yᵢ)²

Where:

ŷᵢ = predicted value

yᵢ = actual value

n = number of data points


Gradient Descent
Gradient descent tries to find the global minimum of the cost function, moving step by step.

If the learning rate (step size) is:

Too high → might overshoot the minimum.

Too low → might take too long to converge or get stuck.

________________________________________


Decision Tree Regressor
Goal: Predict a continuous target variable by splitting data into regions with minimal variance.

Split Criteria:
Instead of entropy or Gini (used in classification), regression trees use Variance Reduction or Mean Squared Error (MSE) reduction.

Steps:
Variance Calculation for a Node:

$$
Var(t) = \frac{1}{n_t} \sum_{i=1}^{n_t} (y_i - \bar{y_t})^2
$$

Where:  
- \( n_t \) = number of samples in the node  
- \( y_i \) = actual value of sample  
- \( \bar{y_t} \) = mean of target values in that node

Variance Reduction (VR):
$$
VR = Var(\text{parent}) - \left( \frac{n_L}{n} Var(L) + \frac{n_R}{n} Var(R) \right)
$$

Where:  
- \( n_L, n_R \) = number of samples in left/right child node  
- \( Var(L), Var(R) \) = variance of left/right child node  
- \( n \) = total samples in parent node


Choosing the Split:

The split that maximizes variance reduction becomes the root or decision node.

The process repeats recursively until a stopping condition is met (like max depth or min samples per leaf).

________________________________________

Model Evaluation
Model evaluation is the process of measuring how well a model performs.
A good model balances underfitting and overfitting:

Underfitting → Model performs poorly on both training and testing datasets (too simple, fails to capture patterns).

Overfitting → Model performs very well on training data but poorly on testing data (memorizes instead of generalizing).

For Classification Problems
When datasets are balanced, Accuracy is a good metric:

Accuracy = Correct Predictions / Total Predictions
​
 
When datasets are imbalanced, focus more on Precision and Recall instead of accuracy:

Precision → Of all predicted positives, how many are actually positive?

Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
​
 
Recall (True Positive Rate, TPR) → Of all actual positives, how many did the model correctly predict?


Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
 
False Positive Rate (FPR) → Cost of incorrect positive predictions:

FPR = FP / (FP + TN)
​ 
F1-score → Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall (useful for imbalanced datasets):

F1-score = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

Conventional ML vs. Deep Learning

________________________________________

Limitations of Conventional Machine Learning:-

High-dimensional data → Performance often drops without dimensionality reduction.

Unstructured data (images, audio, text) → Conventional ML struggles because it can only handle a certain level of complexity.

Manual feature extraction is required before training.

________________________________________

Deep Learning as a Solution
Works directly with unstructured data (images, videos, audio, text).

Automatic feature extraction — no need for manual engineering.

Can handle very large datasets (unlimited in theory).

Performs parallel computation efficiently.

Has higher capacity to learn complex patterns compared to conventional ML.

Shallow vs. Deep Neural Networks

Shallow Neural Network → 1–2 hidden layers.

Deep Neural Network → 3 or more hidden layers.

Advantages:

Works well for straightforward problems like classification.

Faster to train compared to complex architectures.

Disadvantages:

Cannot handle time-dependent or sequential data.

Does not remember past information.

The past information means

Example:
If given:

"Ali went to the market."

"He bought apples."

The network treats both sentences independently and doesn’t connect “He” to “Ali.”

________________________________________

2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Specialized for: Images, videos, and spatial data (location, arrangement, patterns).

Advantages:

Detects features like edges, shapes, and patterns using filters.

Works well with large visual datasets.

Disadvantages:

Needs a lot of training data.

Requires powerful hardware (GPUs).

Not suitable for time-series data (e.g., stock prices).

________________________________________

Long sequence → A book or 10 years of stock prices.

________________________________________

4. Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs):-
   
Type: Special RNN designed to solve the forgetting problem (RNNs lose earlier information in long sequences).

Handles long sequences better than RNNs.

Good for translation, speech recognition, and time-series prediction.

Disadvantages:

More complex and slower to train.

Requires more computational power.

________________________________________

5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
   
Description: Two networks compete — one generates fake data, the other tries to detect if it’s fake or real.

Advantages:

Creates realistic images, videos, and audio.

Useful for data augmentation when data is limited.

Disadvantages:

Training is tricky and unstable.

Can be misused to create fake content.

Meaning: Controls how quickly the model learns. It’s the step size taken during optimization to minimize the loss function.

Relation to Loss:

The more incorrect predictions the model makes, the higher the loss.

To minimize loss, we use Gradient Descent — an optimization algorithm that updates parameters to move toward the global minima (the point where loss is smallest).

Effect of Learning Rate:

Too low → Model learns very slowly, requiring more computation time.

Too high → Model might overshoot and never reach the global minima.

Goal: Choose a learning rate that balances speed and stability.

________________________________________


2. Batch Size:-
   
Meaning: The number of training examples processed in one forward/backward pass.

Why not use the whole dataset at once?

Large datasets may not fit into memory.

Training on smaller batches allows more frequent parameter updates.

Note: There’s no single “best” batch size — it depends on the dataset, model, and available hardware.

________________________________________


3. Number of Epochs
Meaning: The number of times the model sees the entire training dataset during training.

Process:

After each epoch, the model’s parameters are updated.

Gradient Descent moves toward minimizing the loss (towards the global minima) with each update.

Tip: Too few epochs → underfitting; too many epochs → overfitting.

________________________________________

Deep Learning Overview
Deep Learning (DL) is a subdomain of Machine Learning (ML).

In neural networks, we have many layers of neurons that learn patterns in data.

Applications:

NLP (Natural Language Processing)

CV (Computer Vision)

Types of architectures:

Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNNs)

Encoders/Decoders (used in seq-to-seq, transformers, etc.)

Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch.

________________________________________

Large Language Models (LLMs)
LLMs are a type of AI that can organize and generate text (and other tasks like reasoning, translation, code generation).

They are trained on huge datasets.

They use the Transformer architecture.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Purpose: Retrieve relevant information from external sources and combine it with generation.

Example: You ask a question from a book → the system retrieves relevant sections → joins them in the correct order → generates the final answer.

The retrieval step ensures the model has updated and domain-specific information.

________________________________________

How Neural Networks Work
Two main things happen:

Prediction (Forward Propagation)

Input enters the input layer

Passes through hidden layers (transformations occur)

Reaches the output layer

Loss function compares predictions with actual labels.

Training (Backward Propagation)

Starts from the loss function at the output layer.

Goes backward, adjusting weights to reduce loss.

Uses Gradient Descent to find optimal weights.

This cycle repeats until the model can make better predictions.

________________________________________

Limitations of ANN / Simple Neural Networks / Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNNs)
Too many connections for large inputs

In FCNNs, every neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer.

For images, the input is a huge array of numbers (pixels).

Example:

Greyscale image (single channel): 1000 × 100 → 100,000 pixels.

Colored image (3 channels): 1000 × 100 × 3 → 300,000 values.

. Greyscale Image Example
Dimensions: 1000 × 100

1000 → height (rows of pixels)

100 → width (columns of pixels)

Since it's grayscale, each pixel has 1 value.

📌 Total pixels = height × width = 1000 × 100 = 100,000 pixels

Each pixel stores 1 value → 100,000 values total.

3. Colored Image Example (RGB)
Dimensions: 1000 × 100 × 3

1000 → height

100 → width

3 → color channels (Red, Green, Blue).

📌 Total pixel values = height × width × channels = 1000 × 100 × 3
= 300,000 values.

Here’s why:

For each pixel, you need 3 numbers (e.g., R=150, G=200, B=50).

So colored images store 3 times more data than grayscale.

________________________________________


Why CNN is Better for Image Classification:-

1. Images as Data
Greyscale image (single channel):
Size = width × height = 1000 × 100 = 100,000 pixels.

Colored image (3 channels):
Size = width × height × channels = 1000 × 100 × 3 = 300,000 values.

In a simple ANN, each neuron in one layer connects to every neuron in the next layer → huge number of weights → very slow and inefficient for large images.

2. Features in Images
Images contain features:
Edges, textures, shapes, faces, tails, noses, ears, etc.

CNN’s job: automatically detect and learn these features.

________________________________________

3. Main Components of CNN:-
   
Convolutional Layer

Uses filters (kernels) to detect features like edges, curves, shapes.

Example:

Vertical edge detector → detects vertical lines.

Horizontal edge detector → detects horizontal lines.

Why called "convolutional"?
Because it applies the convolution operation (small matrix over a large image to extract features). The term was already used in image processing software like Photoshop.

Convolutional Operation

A small matrix (filter) slides over the large image matrix.

At each position → multiply element-wise and sum → result stored in feature map.

Pooling Layer (Downsampling)

Removes unnecessary information.

Summarizes feature maps (e.g., Max Pooling keeps only the strongest feature in a region).

Flatten Layer

Converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector before sending it to fully connected layers.

Fully Connected Layers (FC Layers)

Also called the "head" of the network.

Performs the final classification based on extracted features.

________________________________________

4. How CNN Layers Learn Complex Patterns
First layer → learns simple features (straight lines, curves, edges).

Second layer → combines simple features to detect more complex shapes (corners, small patterns).

Third layer → combines complex shapes into objects (e.g., multiple squares → cube → book).

Deeper layers → learn high-level, abstract features sufficient for classification.

________________________________________

Summary Flow:

Convolutional layer → detects features.

Pooling layer → summarizes and reduces data.

Repeat multiple convolution + pooling steps → deeper features.

Flatten layer → converts to vector.

Fully connected layers → classification.

________________________________________

1. Strides
Definition: Number of pixels (rows/columns) the filter moves in each step.

Example:

Stride = 1 → moves 1 pixel right, 1 pixel down.

Stride = 2 → moves 2 pixels right, 2 pixels down → reduces feature map size faster.

Effect: Larger stride = smaller output feature map.

________________________________________

2. Padding
Purpose: Prevent feature map size from shrinking too much and help preserve border features.

Types:

Zero Padding: Add zeros around the border.

Same Padding: Adds just enough padding so that output size = input size (when stride = 1).

Valid Padding: No padding → feature map shrinks.

Note: Padding values are not always zeros—sometimes “reflect” or “replicate” padding is used.

________________________________________

3. Volume Convolution (RGB images)
RGB image = Height × Width × Depth (Depth = 3 channels).

Filters also have depth = 3 so they can process all channels at once.

Depth of CNN layer = number of filters → each filter produces one feature map.

Example: If you have 32 filters, output depth = 32.

________________________________________

4. Pooling
Purpose: Reduce spatial dimensions (Height, Width) while keeping important information.

Types:

Max Pooling: Keeps only the largest value in each region.

Average Pooling: Takes the mean of values in each region.

Advantages of Max Pooling:

Keeps the strongest features (feature retention).

Translation invariance → detects features even if shifted.

Reduces computation and risk of overfitting.

________________________________________

Autoencoders – Summary Notes
1. Why Autoencoders?
In CNNs, max pooling is used to reduce size and remove redundant info.

If data has no redundancy, pooling may cause information loss.

For cases where we still want compression without losing essential information, we use Autoencoders.

2. Definition
Autoencoder is a special type of neural network that:

Takes an input.

Compresses it into a latent (compressed) representation.

Reconstructs the same input from that representation.

In math terms: Output ≈ Input (identity function).

3. Example
Input image size: 28 × 28 × 1 → 784 pixels.

Encoder compresses 784 numbers → 32 numbers.

Decoder takes 32 numbers → reconstructs the original 28×28 image.

4. Components
Encoder – Compresses input to a latent vector.

Detects important features.

Reduces size step-by-step using Convolution + Pooling.

Latent Representation – The compressed form of the input.

Decoder – Reconstructs the input from latent representation.

Uses Upsampling / Unpooling / Deconvolution.

5. Training Goal
Train the network so that:

Reconstructed Output
≈
Original Input
Reconstructed Output≈Original Input
Once trained:

Encoder can be used alone for feature extraction / compression.

Decoder can be used alone for generation.

6. Workflow
Encoder:
Input → Convolutional layers (feature detection) → Pooling (reduce size) → Flatten → Fully connected layers → Latent vector.

Decoder:
Latent vector → Fully connected layers → Reshape → Deconvolution → Unpooling/Upsampling → Output image.

7. Key Terms
Latent Vector / Latent Space → Compressed feature representation.

Upsampling / Unpooling → Expanding the compressed representation back into the original image dimensions.

Deconvolution (Transposed Convolution) → Opposite of convolution, used for reconstruction.

What is Time-Series Data?
Time-series data is information where the order and sequence of data points matter. If you break the order, the data loses its meaning.

For example, your daily temperature data for a year. The temperature on Day 2 depends on the temperature from Day 1. If you mix up the days, the information becomes useless. Your example of stock market data is another perfect one. The price of a share on any given day is connected to its price on the previous days.

This is also called sequential data. The main difference from other types of data is that time plays a crucial role. You can use past data (e.g., the last 20 days) to predict the future (the 21st day).

A time step is simply a single entry in the sequence. If you have stock data for 21 days, each day's data is a single time step.

Why Not Use Other Neural Networks?
Your movie analogy explains this perfectly: Imagine you join a movie late. You don't know the story or why two characters are fighting. Your friends who have been watching from the beginning understand the context of the fight because they have seen the entire story.

Other neural networks (like ANNs or CNNs) are like the person who joined late. They treat each data point as an independent sample, without any memory or understanding of the previous data points.

They can't see the "story" or context of the data. This is why they aren't optimal for time-series data. We need a model that has a memory of past events and can use that to make predictions.

How RNNs Are Different and Why They Are Best for Time-Series
RNNs are the solution because they have an internal memory. The special part of an RNN is the recurrent cell or recurrent neuron. This neuron has the ability to remember past information.

In an RNN, the model doesn't just take the current input; it also takes the "summary" of the previous steps (called the hidden state). This hidden state acts like a running summary of the entire sequence up to that point. It's like a computer that saves its progress after every step.

This is what makes RNNs special:

Internal Memory: They process data sequentially, building up a memory of the past.

Contextual Understanding: They can understand the context of the data because they remember previous information. This allows them to make predictions based on the full story, not just a single data point.

What Are LSTMs and GRUs?
A basic RNN can struggle with remembering information over very long sequences. It might "forget" things that happened far in the past.

To solve this, we use two advanced types of recurrent cells:

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Think of LSTMs as having a long-term memory. They use special "gates" to decide what information to keep in their memory, what to forget, and what to output. Your idea of a "forget gate" is exactly right.

GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit): GRUs are a simpler version of LSTMs. They also use gates to control the flow of information, but with fewer gates, making them easier and faster to train in some cases.

________________________________________

Time-Series Data :
Wo data jo samay (time) ke sath change hota hai.
Matlab har record ke saath ek timestamp hota hai.

Examples:
Stock prices (Har second / minute / din ki closing price)

Weather data (Rozana temperature, humidity)

Sensor readings (IoT devices, ECG signals, electricity usage)

Sales data (Har din / mahine ka revenue)

1. Autoencoders (Recap)
Input → Encoder → Latent Representation (compressed info) → Decoder → Reconstructed Output.

Encoder: compress karta h information.

Decoder: dobara reconstruct karta h.

Limitation: Fixed-size latent vector hota hai (context vector).

Problem: Agar sequence lambi ho ya complex info ho → information loss / bottleneck.

2. Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Models
Input: sequence (words, signals, time-series, etc.)

Output: sequence (translated sentence, summary, answer, etc.)

Encoder: pura input sequence ko ek context vector me compress karta h or yeh fix hota (64-D, 128-D, etc.).

Decoder: us context vector se sequence generate karta h.

Applications:

Machine Translation (French → English)

Text Summarization

Question Answering

Chatbots

3. Problems with Vanilla RNN / Seq2Seq
Sequential Processing Only → GPU parallelism ka faida nahi le sakta.

Long-Term Dependency Problem → RNN sirf recent words ko yaad rakhta hai, purani info bhool jata hai.

Bottleneck Problem/context vector  → Encoder ka context vector fixed hota h → large information ko hold nahi kar pata.

4. Attention Models (Improvement)
Attention = "sab data na rakho, sirf important cheez highlight karo".

How it works:

Input sequence me se important info highlight karna.

Har word / token ko score assign karna (kitna important h current output generate karne ke liye).

Attention weights assign karna → high weight = zyada importance.

Decoder har naya word generate karte waqt sirf relevant input parts ko dekhta h.

5. Why Attention Solves RNN Problems?
No fixed bottleneck vector/context vector (kyunki har timestep pe relevant input se info le sakte ho).

Solves long-term dependency (purane words ko bhi weight mil sakta hai).

Training ke baad model khud decide karta hai k kis input pe kitni attention deni h.

Example (Machine Translation)
Input: “Je suis étudiant” (French)
Output: “I am a student”

Without attention: Encoder compress karega poori French sentence ek context vector me → info loss possible.
With attention: Jab "student" generate karna ho, model French word “étudiant” ko high weight dega.

👉 Yani attention = Selective Memory
Sirf wahi data use karo jo output generate karne ke liye zaroori hai.

________________________________________

🔹 Why Transformers?
Old Seq-to-Seq (RNN/LSTM/GRU) problems:

Training sequentially → slow.

Vanishing gradient → Context vector forget ho jata (long sequences handle nai hote).

Hard to train.

✅ Transformers solution:

Parallel training possible.

Self-Attention → Har word directly har dusre word se relate kar sakta hai.

Long dependencies handle karna easy.

Translation, text generation, classification, sab mein use hota hai.

🔹 Transformer = Encoder + Decoder
Transformer architecture basically Autoencoder jaisa hota hai lekin RNN ki jagah Attention use karta hai.

Do main components:

Encoder → BERT (Google)

Decoder → GPT (OpenAI)

🔹 Encoder (BERT-style)
Input embeddings banate hain (words → vectors).

Positional Encoding add karte hain (order maintain karne ke liye using sine/cosine).

Self-Attention → Kis word ko zyada importance deni, kis ko kam.

Multi-Head Attention → Sentence ko alag-alag “perspectives” se dekhte hain (syntax, meaning, tone, etc.).

Example: 1 sentence ko 6 alag “heads” analyze karte hain aur har head different info nikalta hai.

Normalization + Feed Forward ANN lagta hai.

Encoder ka output = contextual embeddings (sentence → matrix of vectors).

🔹 Decoder (GPT-style)
Masked Self-Attention use karta hai:

Training ke waqt next word hide/mask kar dete hain.

Model ek-ek word predict karta hai bina cheating (nahi to leak ho jata).

Encoder ka output + apna previous output use karke next token predict karta hai.

Softmax → jis word ki probability highest ho, usko output de deta hai.

🔹 Multi-Encoders / Multi-Decoders
Agar sirf encoders stack karein → BERT (understanding tasks).

Agar sirf decoders stack karein → GPT (generation tasks).

Agar Encoder + Decoder dono → Translation (original Transformer).

🔹 BERT vs GPT
Feature	BERT (Encoder)	GPT (Decoder)
Direction	Bidirectional (past + future context)	Unidirectional (predict next word only)
Good For	Understanding, classification, embeddings, search, QA	Text generation, story writing, code completion
Training	Masked Language Model (MLM)	Auto-Regressive (predict next word)
Company	Google	OpenAI

🔹 Embeddings & Vector DB
Encoder (BERT) ka output = embeddings (vectors).

Ye embeddings Vector DB mai store hote hain.

Query ko bhi embedding mai convert kar ke compare karte hain (semantic search).

Chunking zaroori hai (agar data bohot zyada ya bohot kam ho, embeddings meaningful nai bante).

🔹 Key Takeaways
BERT (Encoder) = Understanding model (classification, embeddings, search).

GPT (Decoder) = Generative model (next word prediction, story generation, chatbots).

Transformers = Encoder + Decoder → Original translation model.

Self-Attention = word importance.

Multi-Head Attention = multiple perspectives extraction.

Masked Attention (Decoder) = prevents cheating during training.

📘 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) – Revision Notes
1. What is RAG?
Retrieval → External sources se data lana

Augmentation → Data ko improve/structure karna

Generation → Model ke through final output banana

2. LangChain
LangChain = Bridge between data sources and LLMs

Python framework jo RAG implement karne mein help karta hai

6–7 components manage karta hai → kis waqt kaunsa step execute hoga

3. Problems in Information Handling
🔴 Information Overload
Search engines (Google) bahut zyada data dete hain

Useful info extract karna mushkil

Over-information leads to distraction

🔴 Traditional Search Limitations
Keyword-based results

Exact info nahi milti → bohat time lagta hai

🔴 Problems with LLMs
General knowledge dete hain (till 2022 in many models)

Latest info missing

Gemini etc. latest info la dete hain but → unverified / noisy data

Comments ya irrelevant data bhi aa jata hai

4. Solutions to Limitations
✅ Fine-tuning
Model ko specialized data pe dobara train karna

Problem → Expensive, specially for large LLMs

✅ RAG / In-context Learning
LLM ke sath external data attach karna

Response sirf attached documents se generate karna

Control Problem → Agar external data attach na ho to outdated answers milte hain

8. Benefits of RAG
Overcomes LLM limitations

Handles large data

Supports complex queries

Chatbots ka response → zyaada accurate + updated

⚡ Summary:
RAG = External data + LLM → Accurate, controlled, updated answers
LangChain = Framework jo RAG ke components manage karta hai
RAG solves → Overload, outdated info, hallucination

________________________________________

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – Detailed Notes
1. Interaction with LLMs
Normally, for ChatGPT or other LLMs, we interact through a web interface.

Whatever we type is passed as a prompt, and the model generates a response.

In the simplest form of RAG, instead of typing manually, we can write code that automatically:

Sends a query/prompt to the model.

Retrieves the model’s response.

This is considered the simplest Generative AI setup.

2. Core Idea of RAG
In RAG, we connect knowledge sources with the LLM.

A good prompt improves the response quality, but directly searching large datasets is hard.

RAG enables question-answering from large knowledge sources by:

Retrieving the most relevant information.

Passing it into the LLM.

Getting a natural language response.

3. Capabilities
Multilingual:

If the source is in English but we want the answer in Urdu, Spanish, or Arabic → RAG supports this.

Multimodal:

Understanding can be done in two ways:

Natural Language (text)

Vision (speech, images)

Using both text and images for better understanding = multimodal RAG.

4. RAG Pipeline
(a) Ingestion
Loading Data: Bring raw data into the system.

Splitting Data (Splitters):

Data is divided into smaller chunks for processing.

Since LLMs have a limited context window, we cannot feed huge documents directly.

Types of splitters:

Recursive Splitter

Markdown Splitter

HTML Splitter

Semantic Splitter

Chunk Overlap: When chunks are related, we keep some overlapping words so meaning is preserved.

(b) Embeddings
LLMs cannot work directly with raw text → they require numerical/vector representation.

Each chunk is converted into embeddings (vectors).

Embeddings capture semantic meaning:

Cosine similarity is used →

If vectors are close → meanings are similar.

If far apart → meanings are different.

Example: BERT is an embedding model that learns meaningful word representations.

(c) Indexing
After embeddings are created, they are stored/indexed for efficient retrieval.

When a query comes in:

Embedding of query is computed.

Closest vectors (by cosine similarity) are retrieved.

These retrieved chunks are passed to the LLM for final answer generation.

5. Applications of RAG
Question-Answering Systems (chatbots, support assistants).

Classification tasks (e.g., cat vs. dog).

Multilingual & Multimodal assistants.

Knowledge-intensive tasks (summarization, fact checking, legal/medical Q&A).

________________________________________

📘 Vector Database (VectorStore) – Easy Explanation
Why do we need Vector Databases?
Hum data ko efficiently store aur retrieve karna chahte hain. Normal RDBMS (MySQL, SQL Server etc.) tab use hota hai jab humein exact data chahiye – jaise YouTube pe search "Atif Aslam songs" karein to woh singer ke saare songs de dega.

Lekin agar humein approximate ya semantic search chahiye (jaise "romantic Pakistani singer songs" aur exact singer ka naam yaad nahi), to system embeddings create karega aur un embeddings ko Vector Database me store karega. Query ke embeddings aur stored vectors ke beech cosine similarity / dot product nikal kar jo closely related results hain woh return kar dega.

Why the name "Vector DB"?
Computer kisi bhi data ko numbers / vectors ki form me samajhta hai.

Har text, image, ya audio ko embeddings ki form me vectors banaya jata hai.

In vectors ko efficiently store aur retrieve karne ke liye alag type ka database bana – jise Vector Database kehte hain.

Components of a VectorDB
Har VectorDB me yeh 4 cheezein zaroor hoti hain:

Vector Embeddings – Jaise cat picture ko vector form me store karna.

Metadata – Additional info about vector (e.g., "file_name", "author").

Original Information – Jo text ya info vector represent karta hai.

Unique ID – Har vector ko identify karne ke liye.

How VectorDB finds Similar Vectors?
Mathematical Operators:

Dot Product

Cosine Similarity

Example: Agar ek song input me diya, embeddings banengi, cosine similarity apply hogi aur system wahi songs dikhayega jo uske closest vectors hain.

⚠️ Challenge: Agar 1 million vectors ho, to har query ke against 1M similarity calculate karna costly hai. Isi liye VectorDB specialized indexing algorithms (like HNSW, IVF) use karta hai jo fast nearest neighbor search provide karti hain.

Types of Vector Stores
Locally Based

Aap apne system pe store karte ho.

Example: Faiss, Chroma.

Sensitive data ke liye best.

Cloud Based

API keys ke zariye third-party manage karte hain.

Example: Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate.

Scalable, easy to manage.

Use Cases of VectorDB
Retrieval – Queries ke relevant documents laana.

Semantic Search – Approximate meaning-based results.

Recommendation Systems – Similar songs, movies, products suggest karna.

Anomaly Detection – Agar query ka match na mile to system alert kar sake.

📌 Pinecone Architecture
Project: Ek project ke andar multiple indexes bana sakte ho.

Index: Ek index ka matlab ek vector space, jisme multiple vectors hote hain.

Namespace:

Namespaces ek tarah ka logical separation hai.

Example: Agar ek index me multiple clients ka data store karna ho, to har client ka data alag namespace me store kar dete hain.

Isse queries aur data segregation easy hota hai.

📌 Qdrant Architecture
Collection:

Qdrant me "collection" ek group hota hai vectors ka (similar to Pinecone index).

Namespaces (Collections ke andar):

Har collection ke andar multiple subsets manage kiye ja sakte hain.

Example: Ek "Songs" collection hai, aur uske andar namespaces ho sakti hain – "Pakistani", "Indian", "English".

✅ Namespaces ka Role (Summary):

Data ko partition / separate karne ke liye use hota hai.

Har client, project, ya category ka data alag rakha ja sakta hai.

Query performance aur data isolation dono improve hote hain.

🔎 Retrieval in Vector Databases
Retrieval means fetching relevant information from ingested knowledge/data. In modern AI systems, we store data in a VectorStore so that machines can understand and search efficiently. Retrieval works by comparing query vectors (user’s question) with stored vectors (chunks of documents).

⚙️ How Retrieval Works
User Query → You ask a question in text form.

Vectorization → The query is converted into an embedding vector (using an embedding model).

Comparison with Database → This query vector is compared with vectors stored in the VectorStore.

Similarity Search → The system finds the n most similar vectors (chunks of text) using mathematical operations like:

Dot Product

Cosine Similarity

MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance)

👉 The most similar vectors are fetched along with their metadata (e.g., page number, source).
👉 These chunks are passed to an LLM (like GPT) for final answer generation.

📂 VectorStore as a Retriever
Every VectorStore provides built-in retrieval methods. There are two main retrieval techniques:

1) Semantic Search (Cosine Similarity / Dot Product)
Converts query into a vector.

Finds the top-k closest vectors using similarity scores.

Good for broad and complete information retrieval.

Example:

Query: “What is dynamic programming?”

Output: All chunks related to Dynamic Programming (definitions, examples, advantages).

2) MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance)
Solves the problem of repetitive chunks.

Selects chunks that are both relevant and diverse.

Removes redundancy and ensures only unique + useful chunks are retrieved.

we use filters here

Good for concise answers.

Example:

If query returns 9 chunks but 4 are repetitive → MMR filters them and only returns unique info.

🛠️ Other Retrieval Methods
🔹 TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)
Traditional NLP method (before embeddings).

Finds importance of a word by:

TF = How often a word appears in a document.

IDF = How rare the word is across all documents.

Higher score = More important word.

Used for keyword-based retrieval, but doesn’t capture semantic meaning.

🔹 SVM (Support Vector Machine Retrieval)
A machine learning classifier that can also be used for retrieval.

Separates relevant vs irrelevant documents using hyperplanes.

Works well when we have labeled training data (e.g., relevant vs non-relevant examples).

Used less in modern LLM-based retrieval (embeddings are more efficient), but still useful in supervised search systems.

🔑 Why Metadata is Important in Retrieval?
Metadata = extra info stored with each vector (e.g., page number, author, date).

Helps in filtering results (e.g., only get results from Page 3).

Improves context-specific search.

✅ Summary
Retrieval = finding relevant chunks from VectorStore.

Dot Product & Cosine Similarity = measure closeness between query and stored vectors.

Semantic Search = fetches all related chunks.

MMR = fetches unique, non-repetitive chunks (concise).

TF-IDF = keyword-based search (old method).

SVM = supervised retrieval (less common now).

⚡ So when you need all information → use Semantic Search.
⚡ When you need concise & non-redundant info → use MMR.


LLMs & Model Sizes
LLM = Large Language Model → works like a brain (analyzes + generates text).

Different models → have different context windows (how much text they can read/remember at once).

GPT-4: very powerful, big context, but expensive.

GPT-4-mini: lightweight, cheaper, faster, good when we only need analysis power, not very large memory.
→ In RAG systems, we only need the relevant chunk of info, so using smaller models is efficient.

RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
RAG = Retrieve only important info from database → give it to LLM for answer.

No need to send huge datasets, only query-related info.

Hence, small + fast model (GPT-4 mini) works better.

Chains in LangChain
Chains = connect multiple steps/components together to make workflows (e.g., chatbot).

LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) Chains → allow building custom chatbots with flexibility.

Chain Calling Methods
Stream → executes chain block by block (good for live responses).

Invoke → executes the entire chain at once.

Batch → for multiple inputs together (efficient for bulk queries).

Runnable Types
Runnable Sequence:

Steps run in sequence (output of one = input of next).

Example: query → retrieve → summarize → format answer.

Runnable Parallel:

Steps run together (no dependency between outputs).

Example: translate → sentiment analysis → classification all at once.

Prompt Engineering
