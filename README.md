AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a domain of computer science in which we mimic the thinking and understanding process of the human brain.
Its goal is to create a digital brain that can think like humans, make decisions, and solve problems.

📌 Example:
If you ask Siri or Google Assistant something and it responds, then it is using AI.

________________________________________

 In simple words, it tells us what is the best thing to do in any situation to get the best result.

Imagine a student is preparing for an exam. He tries different strategies:

Sometimes he studies late at night.

Sometimes he studies early in the morning.

Sometimes he uses YouTube videos.

Sometimes he reads textbooks.

Over time, he notices this:

📌 “Whenever I wake up early and revise with YouTube videos, I score higher in quizzes.”

Asking kids open-ended questions like “What’s your favorite color?” gives different answers — like normal AI, which gives varied responses.

But if you give them a math question like “(3 + 2) × 4”, they all say “20” — like Q*, which finds the single best answer in any situation.

So he learns:
✅ Best Action = Wake up early + Watch videos

________________________________________

Machine Learning (ML) says:

"Just give me inputs and outputs (past data), and I’ll learn the pattern behind them. Once I learn the pattern, I can predict answers for future inputs."

Deep Learning (DL) goes a step further:

"I’m inspired by how the human brain works. I use artificial 'neurons' (which are actually mathematical functions), and when many of them are connected together in layers, we call that a neural network."

________________________________________

Labelled data is the type of data where each input is provided along with its correct output (label).

📌 Example:
If you're shown an image of an apple and told that "this is an apple," then that is labelled data.
The machine learns from such labelled data, like:
Image → Apple
Image → Not Apple

________________________________________

Unlabelled data is the type of data where inputs are provided without any labels — meaning, we don't know the correct output for each input.

📌 Example:
Images stored in your phone gallery are unlabelled because they are not tagged with what they contain (like "apple", "car", or "person").
Most of the data in the real world is unlabelled.

________________________________________

Structured data is the type of data that is organized in rows and columns, making it easy to store and analyze — just like in an Excel spreadsheet.
📌 Example:
An Excel file where each row represents a person and each column represents features like Name, Age, and Gender.


Unstructured data is data that does not have a organized structure like rows and columns. It includes things like texts, images, videos, and speech.

Example:

Emails or written documents

Photos stored on your phone

Audio clips

Video recordings

Reinforcement Learning Explanation (Based on Example)
Scenario: Gharwale bike chalana sikhate hain. Rules batate hain. Environment define karte hain. Kab brake lagani hai, kya sahi hai kya nahi.

🧠 Mapping to RL Concepts:
Real-life Term	RL Term
Gharwale rules batate hain	Environment + Reward policy
"Ghar ke andar nahi chalani"	Environment constraint
Brake, race, kick sikhana	Action space
Aram se drive karna	Optimal policy learned
Wheeling karna	Undesirable behavior
Gharwale mana karte hain	Negative reward (punishment)
Baccha wheeling chhor deta hai	Unlearning due to penalty

________________________________________

🔁 Learning + Unlearning:
Jab baccha aram aram se chalata hai → positive reward milta hai (tareef, encouragement).

Jab wo wheeling karta hai → negative reward (daant, punishment).

Jab ye negative feedback repeat hota hai → wo unlearn karta hai wheeling ko.

Reinforcement Learning mein agent action karta hai, environment usay reward ya punishment deta hai, aur agent apna behavior update karta hai.

📌 Summary:
Learning = Bike chalana sikhna through positive reinforcement.

Unlearning = Wheeling chhodna due to repeated negative reinforcement.

RL Concept = Agent interacts with environment, learns from reward and punishment.

_______________________________________

✅ Supervised Learning
There’s a small child at my home, and I often teach him the names of different fruits:

🍎 "This is an apple"
🍌 "This is a banana"
🍊 "This is an orange"

One day, I showed him an apple and asked:
"What is this?"
He replied confidently:
"It's an apple!"

_______________________________________

Unsupervised Learning
Now imagine I send someone to the market with this instruction:
"Buy fruits or vegetables you like."

🛒 They go to the store and pick whatever seems good to them, based on their personal preferences – without being told what to buy specifically.

📌 This represents Unsupervised Learning – where the model doesn’t get labeled data but finds patterns or groups things on its own.

________________________________________

Deep Learning Overview
In deep learning, we can still apply supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning, but the difference is that the model is trained using artificial neurons.

What is a Neuron?
A neuron in deep learning is a mathematical function.
For example, one simple function is the Relu neuron (max function):
•	It takes two numbers as input.
•	It outputs the larger number.
This is similar to how biological neurons in the human brain take inputs, process them, and pass outputs to other neurons.
________________________________________
Connecting Neurons
Just like the human brain has billions of interconnected neurons that make decisions, in deep learning we connect artificial neurons to form a neural network.
This arrangement of neurons can have different architectures depending on the problem.
________________________________________
Data in ML vs. DL
•	Machine Learning (ML) works well with structured data (tables, rows, columns).
•	Deep Learning (DL) can work with both structured and unstructured data(Text , Image , Voice):
o	Text → becomes Natural Language Processing (NLP)
o	Images → becomes Computer Vision
o	Voice/Speech → becomes Speech Recognition

________________________________________

Discriminative AI vs Generative AI
1. Discriminative AI
•	Definition:
Focuses on distinguishing between different classes or categories.
It learns patterns in data to decide “What class does this belong to?”
•	Goal: Classification or prediction.
•	Example:
o	Email spam detection (Spam or Not Spam)
o	Image classification (Cat or Dog)
________________________________________
2. Generative AI
•	Definition:
Focuses on creating new data that resembles the original data.
It may use discriminative AI techniques internally to understand patterns, but its main goal is generation, not classification.
•	Example:
o	ChatGPT writing an essay
o	 Creating Ghibli image from text
o	AI making new music

________________________________________

In deep learning, the word deep comes from the depth of the neural network, meaning:
•	We don’t just have one or two layers of neurons (like in simple neural networks)
•	Instead, we have many hidden layers between the input and output layers.
•	More layers = more neurons = the model can learn more complex patterns.
So, “deep” is about layer depth
For example:
•	Shallow Neural Network → 1–2 hidden layers
•	Deep Neural Network → 3+ hidden layers (can go into hundreds in big architectures like ResNet, GPT, etc.)

________________________________________

Generative AI & LLMs
Generative AI uses certain aspects of Discriminative AI (pattern recognition) but goes further — it creates new information such as text, images, or audio.
For text data, two important model families are:
1.	LLMs (Large Language Models)
2.	Diffusion Models (e.g., Latent Diffusion Models for image generation)
Both can use special neural network architectures like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) — these have billions of parameters (like artificial neurons) working together.

________________________________________

Tokenization in LLMs
•	LLMs don’t directly understand raw text; they break text into tokens (small chunks like words or sub-words).
•	Example: "I’m learning AI" → [ "I", "’m", " learning", " AI" ]
•	GPT understands a fixed vocabulary (e.g., ~50,000 tokens it has learned during training).
•	If a token is out of vocabulary, the model won’t interpret it correctly.
•	Context Window = the maximum number of tokens the LLM can process at once.
o	GPT-3.5 → ~4k tokens
o	GPT-4 → 8k–32k tokens (depending on version)

________________________________________

Prompt Engineering Steps
To get the best results from an LLM, your prompt should include:
•  Simulate Persona → Define the role the model should take.
Example: “You are an expert Python developer.”
•  Task → Clearly state what you want the model to do.
Example: “Write a function to reverse a string.”
•  Steps → Explain how to approach the problem (break it into parts).
Example: “First, take input from the user, then reverse it, and finally print the result.”
•  Context / Constraints → Give boundaries or rules for the answer.
Example: “Do not use built-in reverse functions; only use loops.”
•  Goal → Describe the desired outcome.
Example: “The program should work for any string entered by the user.”
•  Output Format → Tell how you want the results presented.
Example: “Return the code inside a single Python code block.”

________________________________________

LLMs vs Diffusion Models
________________________________________

1. LLMs (Large Language Models)
LLMs are actually Transformers — a type of neural network architecture.

You get better results when you give clear, step-by-step prompts.

Adding emotional touch in prompts can improve the quality of generated content.

________________________________________

2. Diffusion Models
Diffusion models generate images based on text prompts.

Example: Stable Diffusion (comes under Computer Vision).

You can sell generated images, but success depends on good prompt writing.

Negative Prompts → Used to exclude unwanted elements from the image.

They are computationally expensive, so latent representation is used:

Instead of representing an image with millions of numbers (pixels), it’s represented with fewer (e.g., 1,000) numbers.

This makes training faster and more efficient.

________________________________________

3. Noise in Diffusion Models
   
Noise = Random variation added to the image data (like static on TV).

The model is trained to remove noise and recover the real image.

Forward process: Gradually add noise to an image over time.

Backward process: Gradually remove noise to reconstruct the image.

Example: Drawing too many lines on a picture, then removing them step-by-step until the original image appears.

________________________________________

4. Two Ways to Add/Remove Noise
  1) Equal step noise addition → Add equal noise at each step, then remove it.

  2)Cosine similarity noise → Uses a cosine schedule for adding noise.
    (Forward process and Reverse process)
    Cosine schedule → add blur slowly at first, faster in the middle, then slow down again — giving a smoother transformation.
    It uses a cosine-shaped curve for adding noise

________________________________________

5. Latent Diffusion Components
Autoencoder → Compresses image into a smaller latent space.

U-Net → Learns to remove noise.

Text Autoencoder → Encodes the prompt into embeddings.

Guided Noise Removal → The process of removing noise in a controlled sequence.

________________________________________

6. Embeddings
Embeddings = Numerical representation of text prompts (meaning is stored as numbers).

The model uses embeddings to understand what the prompt means and guide image creation.

________________________________________

1) API as a Waiter: 
•	Customer (You) → Makes a request (like ordering food).
•	Waiter (API) → Takes your request and delivers it to the Kitchen (Server).
•	Kitchen → Prepares the food (processes the data or performs the required operation).
•	Waiter (API) → Brings the food (response) back to you.
•	Key point: You don’t know (or need to know) how the kitchen works — only how to place the order correctly.

________________________________________

2️) Example with Google Search
•	When you type something into Google and hit Search, your browser is sending a request to Google’s Search API.
•	The API sends your query to Google’s servers, fetches relevant results, and sends them back.
•	You just see the results; you don’t see the inner algorithms, databases, or processing steps.

CODE OF SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

import openai

# Replace with your actual key
openai.api_key = "sk-your_real_api_key_here"




def sentiment_analysis(text):

    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a sentiment analysis assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"Analyze the sentiment of this text: {text}"}
    ]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=messages,
        max_tokens=50,
        temperature=0
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].message['content']
    result = sentiment_analysis("I hate you.")
    print("Sentiment:", result)

________________________________________

🖼 DALL·E, CLIP & Diffusion Models

DALL·E and DALL·E 3 are AI models for generating images from text prompts.

They are built on diffusion models, which create images step-by-step from random noise, refining them until the final picture appears.

DALL·E uses CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) technology.

Text Encoder → Converts the text prompt into a vector.

Image Encoder → Converts images into vectors.

These vectors are compared for similarity, ensuring the generated image matches the text.

Once the text–image relationship is established, a diffusion-based decoder generates the image.
________________________________________

📦 Pipeline: 

A pipeline is just a sequence of steps to process data.

Think of ordering a pizza:

Choose toppings

Bake the pizza

Deliver it

In AI, the pipeline processes data step-by-step, e.g., text → vector → model processing → output.

________________________________________

🔢 Tensors:

A tensor is basically a multi-dimensional matrix used to store data (numbers) in deep learning.

1D tensor = vector, 2D tensor = matrix, higher dimensions store more complex data (like images or videos).

________________________________________

🤗 Hugging Face:

Hugging Face is a platform with thousands of ready-to-use AI models.

You can find models for:

Text summarization

Translation

Sentiment analysis

Image generation

And many more

Always check the model size before loading in notebook — large models can crash your notebook if they exceed memory limits.

📊 Data Science Overview
Data Science is a multi-disciplinary field because it combines concepts from many areas like statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain knowledge.
Its main goal is to extract insights from data to make better decisions.

________________________________________

1️⃣ Step 1: Data Acquisition
In this step, data can come from various sources such as:
Databases
Data Lakes
Data Warehouses
This is the starting point of any data science project.

________________________________________

2️⃣ Step 2: Data Preparation & EDA
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is very important because we need to understand:

What type of data we have

The meaning of each attribute (column)

How values are distributed because of inconsistencies i.e age = 670 

Whether there are missing or incorrect values

________________________________________


📌 Types of Data

1. Nominal Data
Categories without order or rank.

Example: Red, Green, Blue.

2. Binary Data
Only two unique values.

Example: Yes/No, 0/1.

3. Ordinal Data
Categories with an order.

Example: A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D+, D, F.

4. Numerical Data
Numbers that represent measurable quantities.

Discrete → Only certain unique values are possible. Example: 0, 1, 2.

Continuous → Values can be measured and can take any number within a range. Example: Height, Weight, Temperature.

________________________________________

📊 Statistical Properties & Data Distribution
When analyzing data, we often look at its statistical properties and distribution.

________________________________________

1️⃣ Measures of Central Tendency
(“Central tendency” means the tendency of data to cluster around a middle value — in Urdu: “darmiyani value ki taraf jhukao”)

Mean → The average of all values.

Median → The middle value after sorting the data.

Mode → The most frequently occurring value.

________________________________________

2️⃣ Measures of Dispersion
(Shows how spread out the data is from the central value)

Standard Deviation (SD) → How much data deviates from the mean.

Variance → Square of the standard deviation.

Note: Variance & SD are meaningful only if Mean is used as the central tendency measure.

IQR (Interquartile Range) → Spread between Q3 (75th percentile) and Q1 (25th percentile).

________________________________________

3️⃣ Measures of Proximity
(Used to find similarity or closeness between two or more values/vectors)

Dot Product

Cosine Similarity

Correlation

________________________________________

4️⃣ Data Distribution
Types
Symmetric Distribution (Normal) → Mean = Median = Mode.

Asymmetric Distribution (Skewed):

Positively Skewed → Mode < Mean (tail on positive side).

Negatively Skewed → Mean < Mode (tail on negative side).

________________________________________

🔄 Step 3: Data Preprocessing
Giving the model high-quality data is crucial for better results.
Data preprocessing ensures the data is clean, consistent, and optimized for training.

1️⃣ Data Cleaning
Handle missing values (fill, remove, or impute).

Remove noise (unnecessary/random errors).

Fix inconsistencies (e.g., Age = 670).

2️⃣ Data Integration
Combine data from multiple sources into one dataset.

Example: Merging sales data from different regional databases.

3️⃣ Data Reduction
Remove less important features to make the dataset smaller and easier to process.

Also called Dimensionality Reduction.

Techniques:

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) — works using:

Eigen Decomposition

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) — useful for visualization in 2D or 3D.
________________________________________

Data Acquisition → Collecting raw data from various sources.

Preprocessing → Making data ready for modeling.

Step 1: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) → Understanding the data’s patterns, distributions, and anomalies.

Step 2: Feature Engineering → Creating and refining features for better model performance.

a) Data Cleaning → Handle missing values, remove duplicates, fix inconsistencies.

b) Data Integration → Merge multiple datasets into one coherent dataset.

c) Data Reduction → Reduce complexity by selecting important features or using dimensionality reduction.

d) Data Transformation → Change the structure or scale of data for better learning.

________________________________________

📌 Data Transformation Techniques
1. Smoothing
Purpose: Manage noisy, scattered data so the model can learn patterns effectively.

Techniques:

Regression Smoothing → Fit a regression line/curve to reduce noise.

Binning → Group nearby values into bins to reduce variability.

________________________________________

2. Discretization
Purpose: Convert numerical data into ordinal categories.

Example:

Temperature:

0–15 → Low

15–30 → High

>30 → Extreme

________________________________________

3. Normalization (Scaling)
Purpose: Bring values of different columns into a comparable scale so the model learns effectively.

Common techniques:

Z-score Standardization:

Formula: 
$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$
​
Centers data around 0 with standard deviation 1.

________________________________________

Min-Max Scaling:

$X' = \frac{X - X_{\text{min}}}{X_{\text{max}} - X_{\text{min}}}$

Transforms data into a fixed range (e.g., 0 to 1).

Works well if we know future data won’t exceed current min/max values.

________________________________________

Step 3: Analyze (After Acquire → Prepare [EDA + Feature Engineering])
In this step, we focus on finding the model that performs best on our data.

1. Choosing the Right Algorithm
If the output column contains categories → use Classification algorithms.

If the output column is continuous numeric → use Regression algorithms.

________________________________________

2. Ensemble Learning
Ensemble learning combines multiple algorithms to improve performance. There are two main types:

a) Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)

Multiple algorithms are trained in parallel.

Final decision:

Classification → Majority voting

Regression → Average prediction

Reduces variance and helps avoid overfitting.

b) Boosting

Uses weak learners (simple models) trained sequentially.

Each model focuses on fixing errors from the previous one.

Wrong predictions are given more weight in the next round.

Turns weak learners into strong learners.

________________________________________

3. Error & Performance Checking
Regression:

Check Residual error:

Positive residual → Overestimation

Negative residual → Underestimation

Classification:

Confusion Matrix

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

AUC-ROC Curve

________________________________________

4. Reporting
Present results visually for easy understanding.

Use different types of graphs, plots, and dashboards so stakeholders can quickly understand insights.

Goal → Tell a story through visualization so that even non-technical people can grasp the findings.

________________________________________

Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used when the target variable is categorical (e.g., 0 or 1).

Instead of fitting a straight line like in Linear Regression, it uses the Sigmoid (Logistic) Function to map predictions to probabilities.

Sigmoid Function
$\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$


Output is always between 0 and 1.

If probability ≥ threshold → class 1

If probability < threshold → class 0

Default threshold is 0.5, but it can be adjusted based on problem requirements.

Decision Boundary
Logistic Regression tries to find a line (in 2D) or hyperplane (in higher dimensions) that separates the classes.

Works best when the data is linearly separable — meaning a straight line can separate the categories.

Key Notes
Above 0.5 → Class 1, Below 0.5 → Class 0.

We can shift the threshold for better precision or recall, depending on the business goal.

Commonly used for:

Spam detection (Spam / Not Spam)

Medical diagnosis (Disease / No Disease)

Credit approval (Approve / Reject)

________________________________________

Decision Tree
In a decision tree, we try to find which split is pure and which is impure.

Purity is measured using Entropy or Gini Impurity.

If the value is 0, we say the split is pure (all samples belong to one class).

If the value is above 0 and closer to 1, the split is impure (mixed classes), and further splitting can be done.

Key Concepts
Entropy

Measures the randomness/impurity in a node.

Formula:

Entropy(S) = - ∑ pᵢ log₂(pᵢ)
 
Gini Impurity

Measures the probability of incorrectly classifying a randomly chosen element.

Formula:

Gini(S) = 1 - ∑ pᵢ²

 
Information Gain (IG)

Helps to decide which node should be the root node and how to split further.

Calculated at every step:

IG(S, A) = Entropy(S) − ∑ ( |Sᵥ| / |S| ) × Entropy(Sᵥ)

________________________________________

Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble machine learning technique, specifically a type of bagging method.
In Random Forest:

We use n number of Decision Trees (only Decision Trees — no other algorithms).

For each Decision Tree:

Row Sampling with Replacement (Bootstrap Sampling)

Feature Sampling with Replacement (Random Subset of Features)

Each Decision Tree is trained on its own subset of data and features.

For classification:

The final output is decided using Majority Voting Classifier.

Some data is left unused in training for each tree — called OOB (Out-of-Bag) data, approximately n/3 of the dataset.

This OOB data is used for validation, giving the OOB Score (an internal performance estimate).

________________________________________

Gradient Boosting
Gradient Boosting is an ensemble machine learning technique based on boosting.

Uses multiple Decision Trees (usually shallow trees — weak learners).

The trees are connected sequentially.

At each step, we focus on the errors (residuals) made by the previous model.

Only the data points that were predicted incorrectly (or had higher error) get more weight and influence in the next tree.

Over time, the sequence of weak learners combines to form a strong learner.

The process is guided by gradient descent, minimizing a loss function step-by-step.

Key points:

Weak Learners → small, simple Decision Trees.

Sequential Learning → each model learns from previous errors.

Loss Function Optimization → e.g., MSE for regression, Log Loss for classification.

________________________________________

Linear Data
Data is linear when the relationship between input variables (features) and the output variable can be represented by a straight line in a graph.

Data is non-linear when the relationship between features and output cannot be represented by a straight line — the pattern curves or changes direction.

________________________________________

Linear Regression
For applying linear regression, our data should be linear, and the output column must be a continuous variable.

We fit a line and try to find the one that passes closest to all the data points, so our residual error is low.

Residual Error Formula:

Residual Error
=
Actual
−
Predicted
Residual Error=Actual−Predicted
Line Equation:
y = w*x + c

c = intercept (point where line starts on Y-axis)

w = slope (how much y changes when x changes)

Cost Function:

J(w, c) = (1/n) * Σ (ŷᵢ - yᵢ)²

Where:

ŷᵢ = predicted value

yᵢ = actual value

n = number of data points


Gradient Descent
Gradient descent tries to find the global minimum of the cost function, moving step by step.

If the learning rate (step size) is:

Too high → might overshoot the minimum.

Too low → might take too long to converge or get stuck.

________________________________________


Decision Tree Regressor
Goal: Predict a continuous target variable by splitting data into regions with minimal variance.

Split Criteria:
Instead of entropy or Gini (used in classification), regression trees use Variance Reduction or Mean Squared Error (MSE) reduction.

Steps:
Variance Calculation for a Node:

$$
Var(t) = \frac{1}{n_t} \sum_{i=1}^{n_t} (y_i - \bar{y_t})^2
$$

Where:  
- \( n_t \) = number of samples in the node  
- \( y_i \) = actual value of sample  
- \( \bar{y_t} \) = mean of target values in that node

Variance Reduction (VR):
$$
VR = Var(\text{parent}) - \left( \frac{n_L}{n} Var(L) + \frac{n_R}{n} Var(R) \right)
$$

Where:  
- \( n_L, n_R \) = number of samples in left/right child node  
- \( Var(L), Var(R) \) = variance of left/right child node  
- \( n \) = total samples in parent node


Choosing the Split:

The split that maximizes variance reduction becomes the root or decision node.

The process repeats recursively until a stopping condition is met (like max depth or min samples per leaf).

________________________________________

Model Evaluation
Model evaluation is the process of measuring how well a model performs.
A good model balances underfitting and overfitting:

Underfitting → Model performs poorly on both training and testing datasets (too simple, fails to capture patterns).

Overfitting → Model performs very well on training data but poorly on testing data (memorizes instead of generalizing).

For Classification Problems
When datasets are balanced, Accuracy is a good metric:

Accuracy = Correct Predictions / Total Predictions
​
 
When datasets are imbalanced, focus more on Precision and Recall instead of accuracy:

Precision → Of all predicted positives, how many are actually positive?

Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
​
 
Recall (True Positive Rate, TPR) → Of all actual positives, how many did the model correctly predict?


Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
 
False Positive Rate (FPR) → Cost of incorrect positive predictions:

FPR = FP / (FP + TN)
​ 
F1-score → Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall (useful for imbalanced datasets):

F1-score = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

Conventional ML vs. Deep Learning

________________________________________

Limitations of Conventional Machine Learning:-

High-dimensional data → Performance often drops without dimensionality reduction.

Unstructured data (images, audio, text) → Conventional ML struggles because it can only handle a certain level of complexity.

Manual feature extraction is required before training.

________________________________________

Deep Learning as a Solution
Works directly with unstructured data (images, videos, audio, text).

Automatic feature extraction — no need for manual engineering.

Can handle very large datasets (unlimited in theory).

Performs parallel computation efficiently.

Has higher capacity to learn complex patterns compared to conventional ML.

Shallow vs. Deep Neural Networks

Shallow Neural Network → 1–2 hidden layers.

Works well for straightforward problems like classification.

Faster to train compared to complex architectures.

Disadvantages:

Cannot handle time-dependent or sequential data.

Does not remember past information.

The past information means

Example:
If given:

"Ali went to the market."

"He bought apples."

The network treats both sentences independently and doesn’t connect “He” to “Ali.”

________________________________________

2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Specialized for: Images, videos, and spatial data (location, arrangement, patterns).

Advantages:

Detects features like edges, shapes, and patterns using filters.

Works well with large visual datasets.

Needs a lot of training data.

Requires powerful hardware (GPUs).

Not suitable for time-series data (e.g., stock prices).

________________________________________

Handles long sequences better than RNNs.

Good for translation, speech recognition, and time-series prediction.

Disadvantages:

More complex and slower to train.

Requires more computational power.

________________________________________

5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
   
Description: Two networks compete — one generates fake data, the other tries to detect if it’s fake or real.

Advantages:

Creates realistic images, videos, and audio.

Useful for data augmentation when data is limited.

Disadvantages:

Training is tricky and unstable.

Can be misused to create fake content.
