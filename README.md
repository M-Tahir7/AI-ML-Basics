# AI-ML-Basics
AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a domain of computer science in which we mimic the thinking and understanding process of the human brain.
Its main goal is to create a digital brain that can:
Think like humans
Make decisions
Solve problems
📌 Example:
 If you ask Siri or Google Assistant something and it responds, then it is using AI to understand and reply to you.
💡 In Simple Words:
 AI tells us what is the best thing to do in any situation to get the best result.
🎓 Imagine this scenario:
A student is preparing for an exam. He tries different strategies:
Studies late at night
Studies early in the morning
Watches YouTube videos
Reads textbooks
Over time, he learns this:
📌 “Whenever I wake up early and revise with YouTube videos, I score higher in quizzes.”
So he figures out:
✅ Best Action = Wake up early + Watch videos
🎯 Simple Analogy:
Asking kids open-ended questions like:
❓ “What’s your favorite color?”
 gives different answers — just like normal AI, which gives varied responses.
But if you ask:
❓ “What’s (3 + 2) × 4?”

Machine Learning (ML) says:
 "Just give me inputs and outputs (past data), and I’ll learn the pattern behind them using historical data. Once I learn the pattern, I can predict answers for future inputs."
Deep Learning (DL) goes a step further:
 "I’m inspired by how the human brain works. I use artificial 'neurons' (which are actually mathematical functions), and when many of them are connected together in layers, we call that a neural network."
 every kid says “20” — this is like Q*, which finds the single best answer in any situation.

Labelled data is the type of data where each input is provided along with its correct output (label).

📌 Example:
If you're shown an image of an apple and told that "this is an apple," then that is labelled data.
The machine learns from such labelled data, like:
Image → Apple
Image → Not Apple

Unlabelled data is the type of data where inputs are provided without any labels — meaning, we don't know the correct output for each input.

📌 Example:
Images stored in your phone gallery are unlabelled because they are not tagged with what they contain (like "apple", "car", or "person").
Most of the data in the real world is unlabelled.


Structured data is the type of data that is organized in rows and columns, making it easy to store and analyze — just like in an Excel spreadsheet.
📌 Example:
An Excel file where each row represents a person and each column represents features like Name, Age, and Gender.


Unstructured data is data that does not have a organized structure like rows and columns. It includes things like texts, images, videos, and speech.

Example:

Emails or written documents

Photos stored on your phone

Audio clips

Video recordings


Reinforcement Learning Explanation (Based on Your Example)
Scenario: Gharwale bike chalana sikhate hain. Rules batate hain. Environment define karte hain. Kab brake lagani hai, kya sahi hai kya nahi.

🧠 Mapping to RL Concepts:
Real-life Term	RL Term
Gharwale rules batate hain	Environment + Reward policy
"Ghar ke andar nahi chalani"	Environment constraint
Brake, race, kick sikhana	Action space
Aram se drive karna	Optimal policy learned
Wheeling karna	Undesirable behavior
Gharwale mana karte hain	Negative reward (punishment)
Baccha wheeling chhor deta hai	Unlearning due to penalty

🔁 Learning + Unlearning:
Jab baccha aram aram se chalata hai → positive reward milta hai (tareef, encouragement).

Jab wo wheeling karta hai → negative reward (daant, punishment).

Jab ye negative feedback repeat hota hai → wo unlearn karta hai wheeling ko.

Reinforcement Learning mein agent action karta hai, environment usay reward ya punishment deta hai, aur agent apna behavior update karta hai.

📌 Summary:
Learning = Bike chalana sikhna through positive reinforcement.

Unlearning = Wheeling chhodna due to repeated negative reinforcement.

RL Concept = Agent interacts with environment, learns from reward and punishment.



✅ Supervised Learning
There’s a small child at my home, and I often teach him the names of different fruits:

🍎 "This is an apple"
🍌 "This is a banana"
🍊 "This is an orange"

One day, I showed him an apple and asked:
"What is this?"
He replied confidently:
"It's an apple!"


Unsupervised Learning
Now imagine I send someone to the market with this instruction:
"Buy fruits or vegetables you like."

🛒 They go to the store and pick whatever seems good to them, based on their personal preferences – without being told what to buy specifically.

📌 This represents Unsupervised Learning – where the model doesn’t get labeled data but finds patterns or groups things on its own.
